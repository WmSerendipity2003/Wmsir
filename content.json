Before that, I want to find something to do to improve my computer skills. This week’s journal is being made up later, hahaha. 5.08—–5.09今天是来这实习测试工程师的第一天，抱着能学点计算机技术的心态来这找点活干（软件测试）刚见到引荐人就被邀请到办公室喝茶，聊了聊岗位和未来发展。被迫pua剪掉留了半年的长发（我还是很喜欢留长发的），早9晚6有双休。还是可以的。早上hr带我认识了带我的实习老师小英姐，是个少妇。有副和蔼可亲的面孔和温柔细腻的声音，很“职场”的跟我大致讲了这个岗位该做什么……迷茫回到工位有幸遇到两位师兄：张宇奕和郑志培，没想到我跟他们是同龄人，都是非常好相处的人，他们在后面也帮助了我很多，他们已经进来一年多了（要是当时没复读该多好）。由于我是周四来的，这周就上两天班，大概工作内容也已经了解了。Today is my first day as an intern test engineer here. I came here with the hope of learning some computer skills and finding some work to do (software testing). As soon as I met the person who recommended me, I was invited to his office for tea and we talked about the position and future development. I was forced to be flattered and cut my long hair that I had kept for half a year (I still like long hair very much). The working hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. with two days off. It’s still okay. In the morning, the HR took me to meet my internship supervisor, Sister Ying, who is a young woman. She has a kind face and a gentle and delicate voice. She gave me a general idea of what I should do in this position in a very professional way… Feeling confused, I returned to my workstation and was fortunate to meet two senior colleagues: Zhang Yuyi and Zheng Zhipei. I didn’t expect that they were of the same age as me. They are both very easy-going and helped me a lot later. They have been here for more than a year (if I hadn’t repeated my senior year, it would have been great). Since I came on Thursday, I only have two working days this week, but I have already got a rough idea of the work content. 5.12-5.16没想到刚来第一周就有项目可以参与，我参与了”内蒙古大屏-党建引领‘项目模块的运维和测试环境的测试、写用户手册（没想到我人生参与的第一个企业项目来的如此之快），当我以为我是个小白，一点都不知道相关技术在发愁的时候。没想到凭借我的小白计算机知识却完美的完成了这次分配给我的工作，我很诧异（就单纯的把多年玩电脑的经验去找bug发现bug并写在公司的内部软件上上传、写用户手册也是写点点点会出现点点点名副其实的用户手册，共发现10个bug。）当我的作业有了指导老师优秀的评价后，虽然给我讲了漏掉了啥啥啥，但我听的出来她是勉强的挤出几个讲（其实我提交的bug都有写），即使有了好评我也开心不起来，我特地问宇奕师兄：“这就是软件测试吗？” 回答也依然不出我所料。后面了解下我的岗位属于干的是手工测试，属于是0门槛都能干 就是工资少。看我工作速度快，小英姐又把志培兄的任务分我点去测试环境和运维“天工2.0国家版-剖面和过程展望、条件预案、潜力计划的的新增，删除，编辑，签发，字体和模板看看是否匹配。（共发现11个bug）在这次共组中 请教了宇奕师兄一些测试方法”网页检查-Network查看接口和mysql数据库检查（mysql数据库检查方法目前还没具体演示），也不算0收获吧，干完这次我下定决心要把这个岗位的技术都学到再去自学其他计算机相关知识。这周还认识了一位新伙伴-李植，上海中央美院毕业9月份去伦敦读研，跟我真是天差地别，他是来这实习ui设计师的，他个人的兴趣爱好是做游戏 所以才申请去国外。某方面也跟我差不多，不是为了这个岗位来，而是来这学习自己想学的（偶尔工作帮帮忙），都是为了提升自己来的。I never expected to be involved in a project in my first week. I participated in the operation and maintenance and testing environment testing of the “Inner Mongolia Large Screen - Party Building Leadership” project module, and wrote the user manual. (I never thought my first enterprise project would come so quickly in my life.) When I thought I was a complete novice and had no idea about the relevant technology and was worried, I unexpectedly completed the work assigned to me perfectly with my basic computer knowledge. I was quite surprised. (I simply used my years of computer experience to find bugs, write them in the company’s internal software and upload them, and write the user manual, which was indeed a user manual with some content. I found a total of 10 bugs.) After my work received an excellent evaluation from my supervisor, although she pointed out what I had missed, I could tell she was just squeezing out a few comments (actually, I had written all the bugs I submitted). Even with the good review, I couldn’t be happy. I specifically asked my senior, Yu Yi, “Is this what software testing is?” The answer was still as I expected. Later, I learned that my position was for manual testing, which was something anyone could do, but the salary was low. Seeing how fast I worked, Sister Xiaoying assigned me some of Brother Zhipei’s tasks to test the environment and operation and maintenance: “Tian Gong 2.0 National Edition - Profile and Process Outlook, Condition Plan, Potential Plan’s addition, deletion, editing, signing, and checking if the font and template match. (I found a total of 11 bugs.) During this collaboration, I asked Brother Yu Yi some testing methods: “Web inspection - Network to view interfaces and MySQL database inspection (the method for MySQL database inspection has not been demonstrated in detail yet), so it’s not a complete loss. After finishing this, I made up my mind to learn all the skills of this position before self-studying other computer-related knowledge. This week, I also met a new partner, Li Zhi. He graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Shanghai and is going to study in London in September. We are completely different. He is here for an internship as a UI designer. His personal interest is in making games, which is why he applied to go abroad. In some ways, we are similar. We didn’t come for this position but to learn what we want (and help with work occasionally). We both came here to improve ourselves. 5.19-5.23目前已经没有我能干的事了，这周小英姐就把公司的内部业务流程和培训资料给我 让我去看学习（几十g的视频和一堆ppt），我大致看了下就就是教我们怎么用这个开发的软件（我更偏向于自己上手点点，所以剩下的内容就没看，看不下去）这周闲的我很慌，大家都在电脑疯狂敲，我却在看视频。不过小白就是这样的吧？我再这周自学了linux系统和vim编辑器的使用。也算有所收获学习的过程中我又决定了一件事（实在想找一个能有实质性能有成就感的事，而不是单单看网课学理论知识），我决定自己手敲一个属于自己的博客（就有了这个博客的诞生），花了两天时间完成了本地部署和github上的发布（其中有半天多的时间一直再研究wordpress，最后还是选择hexo）。刚好发布当天是5月20号 ，我的公历生日，本想今天平平淡淡的过就好，晚上嫂子却给了我个惊喜（偷偷点了份蛋糕），在生日当天收到被人送的蛋糕没有人是不开心的，当然我也一样。At present, there’s nothing else I can do. This time, Sister Zhou Xiaoying showed me the company’s internal business processes and training materials (dozens of gigabytes of videos and a bunch of PPTS). I roughly took a look and it was just teaching us how to use this developed software (I prefer to do it myself, so I didn’t look at the rest and couldn’t get through it). This week, I’m really bored. Everyone else is typing crazily on the computer, but I’m watching videos. But is that what Xiaobai is like? This week, I taught myself how to use the linux system and the vim editor. During the learning process, I made another decision (I really wanted to find something that could have substantial performance and a sense of achievement, rather than just watching online courses to learn theoretical knowledge). I decided to start my own blog by hand (and that’s how this blog came into being). It took me two days to complete the local deployment and release on github (during which I spent more than half a day studying wordpress, but in the end, I chose hexo). The day of the release happened to be May 20th, my Gregorian birthday. I had planned to just have a plain day today, but my sister-in-law gave me a surprise in the evening (she secretly ordered a cake). No one is unhappy to receive a cake from someone on their birthday, and of course, I am no exception. 5.25-5.30这周是我在这家公司待的最后一周，是的你没听错，本想着干个3个月走，但我坚持不下去了，并不是说工作难天天加班啥的，而是我对该岗位的工作乏味到了极限，在我确定该岗位提升不了我想要的技术后我决定干满一个月就走（想领满一个月工资）但我五月八号进来的，六月九号又是周末不好凑满一个月，于是我问了HR，他的话大致意思就是“想走可以直接走，不必凑满一个月”。当我还在犹豫时，我问了我师兄“都快到端午节放假了，怎么群里还没有人通知阿？”（钉钉群是咱公司的工作主要联络方式）“阿？已经通知了阿 你没看到吗？”“哪呢？群里确实没人通知阿？”我很懵逼，“微信群阿 你没在里面吗？”师兄很诧异的说。原来公司还有员工的微信群，我到现在才知道，虽说我是后门进来的实习生 不受人尊敬也是正常的“那我周一就我一个傻傻的来了，我该找谁理论？又谁会愿意给实习生加班费？没有任何人通知我端午放假的事，我好歹也做了两个项目，为公司做了贡献，我连微信群都不配进是吗”当时的我已经七窍生烟了，觉得他们把我当作路边一条，当机立断跟HR说我今天就要辞职。果不其然HR答应的很爽快，没有问我任何原因让我跟我的林科哥（引荐人）交代一下就好，就像早料到了一般无情。也许职场就是这般无情可言，大家只看重你的价值，只是我初入茅庐、义气做事罢了。走的前一天，我招呼宇奕师兄和李植（因为平时跟他们两个玩的最好），也跟我的领导老师小英姐发了信息，虽然有点晚，但还是鼓起勇气说了 因为人做事应有始有终。虽然我吐槽了那么多，但这家公司还是很厉害的，最能让我印象深刻的点还是这里的离职手续，当时我整整在那边等了一个早上，需要经过几十个人的线上审查和批准，还需要线下找人签字（线下不是他在忙就是她在忙我跑来跑去等来等去……..）真的很正规（折磨人）不过，也只有本身优秀的公司才有这样的完整体系你说对吧。这趟旅程我没齿难忘，结识了新伙伴 感受了公司的工作体系和职场氛围还有更重要的我未干满一个月却按一个月工资来结算 这还得感谢林科哥的关照 谢谢。This week is my last week at this company. Yes, you heard it right. I was planning to leave after three months, but I can’t hold on anymore. It’s not that the work is hard and I have to work overtime every day, but I’m so bored with this position that I’m at my limit. After I was certain that this position couldn’t improve the technical skills I wanted, I decided to leave after one month (wanting to receive a full month’s salary). However, I came in on May 8th, and June 9th was a weekend, making it difficult to complete a full month’s salary. So I asked the HR, and his general meaning was, “If you want to leave, you can just leave. There’s no need to complete a full month’s salary.” While I was still hesitating, I asked my senior, “The Dragon Boat Festival holiday is almost here. Why hasn’t anyone in the group informed you yet?” “Ah?” (DingTalk groups are the main means of communication for our company’s work.) I’ve already informed you. Didn’t you see it?” “Where?” “Really, no one in the group informed me?” “ I was completely confused. “Aren’t you in the wechat group?” “ The senior brother said in surprise. It turns out that the company has a wechat group for its employees. I only found out now that it’s normal for me, an intern who came in through a backdoor, not to be respected. “Then I came alone on Monday, so who should I argue with?” And who would be willing to pay interns overtime? No one informed me of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. At least I had done two projects and made contributions to the company. I didn’t even deserve to be in the wechat group, did I? At that time, I was completely at a loss and felt that they were treating me like a passer-by. I immediately told the HR that I was going to resign today. Sure enough, the HR agreed very readily. They didn’t ask me for any reason and just told me to explain to my Lin Ke (the referrer), as if they had expected it. Perhaps the workplace is just so heartless. Everyone only values your worth. It’s just that I’m a newcomer and do things with righteousness. The day before I left, I called on Senior Brother Yu Yi and Li Zhi (because I usually get along best with them), and also sent a message to my leader and teacher, Sister Xiao Ying. Although it was a bit late, I still gathered my courage and said that people should see things through to the end. Although I teased so much, this company is still very impressive. What impressed me the most was the resignation procedures here. At that time, I waited there for the whole morning. It needed to go through the online review and approval of dozens of people, and also needed to find someone to sign offline (offline, either he was busy or she was busy, I ran around waiting and waiting to……..). It’s really formal (tormenting). However, only companies that are themselves excellent have such a complete system, don’t you think so? This trip was unforgettable to me. I made new friends, experienced the company’s working system and workplace atmosphere. More importantly, I didn’t work for a full month but was paid as a month’s salary. I have to thank Brother Lin for his care. Thank you.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://wmserendipity2003.github.io/Wmsir/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Fluid","slug":"Fluid","permalink":"http://wmserendipity2003.github.io/Wmsir/tags/Fluid/"}]},{"title":"测试","slug":"first-blog","date":"2025-05-22T01:36:26.407Z","updated":"2025-05-30T10:00:41.415Z","comments":true,"path":"2025/05/22/first-blog/","permalink":"http://wmserendipity2003.github.io/Wmsir/2025/05/22/first-blog/","excerpt":"","text":"初来驾到测试 you are coffee that i need in the morning you are my sunshine in the rain when it is pouting I just wanna see how beautyful you are when you go I follow no matter how far if life is movie you are the best part 海贼王 Youtube 有个小梦想去外企当码农一定要学好英语","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2025-05-20T07:10:00.128Z","updated":"2025-05-27T09:52:50.699Z","comments":true,"path":"2025/05/20/hello-world/","permalink":"http://wmserendipity2003.github.io/Wmsir/2025/05/20/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
